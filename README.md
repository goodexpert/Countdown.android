## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
A carousel timer allows the user to set the count down timer using gestures
and a circular timer can display the time remaining and progress.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I'd like to show that how to manage an internal state of App without a view model
and make a graceful UI, animations, gestures and etc.
